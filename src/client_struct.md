# Client Structure
This section covers the overall structure of the OWOT client rather than any
specific component. In particular we will discuss the following:
* The events system, which is essential to know about for newarly any kind of
  interactive script.
* The way in which the client receives and sends messages to the server will
  be discussed, but not in great depth as that isn't essential to know for
  most basic scripts; more details will be provided in later sections.
* Various useful miscellaneous variables and functions the client has.
