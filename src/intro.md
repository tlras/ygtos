# Introduction
> Note: This guide is not complete *(as of 2023-02-08)*!

This guide is intended to provide someone with decent knowledge of JS with the
information they need to begin making scripts for the OWOT client. If you
don't already know JS, you may try to follow along, but I'd recommend getting
a decent grasp of the language first. Throughout the guide, there will be
plenty of examples to learn from so you can see the various bits of
information you will be taught be put into practice. I heavily encourage you
to create your own small scripts while reading this to solidify the
information in your mind; only knowledge that is used sticks in your mind.

For a quick summary of JS syntax, see [Learn javascript in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/).
Or, if structured tutorials are more your style, then you can try [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/).
Finally, if you want to look up some specific language feature, you can consult the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/).

With that being said, let's get started!
